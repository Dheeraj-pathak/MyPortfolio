      <p class="lead">
        Hello, I’m <strong>Dheeraj Pathak</strong> — an AI/ML enthusiast, Android developer, and full-stack learner currently pursuing my MCA at Lovely Professional University with a CGPA of 9.00.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in crafting intelligent systems, mobile apps, and data-driven applications. My experience spans Java, Python, Android Studio, SQL, and modern web technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        With hands-on work in projects like a House Price Prediction System, Android Quiz App, and JavaFX-based management tools, I bring real-world problem-solving into every line of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond coding, I lead technical events, coordinate cultural initiatives, and actively participate in hackathons to stay sharp and inspired.
