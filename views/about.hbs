      <p class="lead">
        Hello, I’m <strong>Dheeraj Pathak</strong> — a results-oriented Software Engineer skilled in <strong>AI/ML</strong>, <strong>Android</strong>, and <strong>full-stack development</strong>. I’m currently pursuing my MCA at Lovely Professional University (CGPA 9.00), and thrive on delivering robust, scalable, and user-centric applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        My expertise spans Java, Python, SQL/NoSQL, Node.js, and modern web frameworks. I’ve built intelligent systems—from House Price Prediction pipelines to Quiz and VideoCall apps—and crafted clean, maintainable code grounded in problem-solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        I bring strong soft skills as well: critical thinking, adaptability, leadership, and effective team collaboration. I’ve led technical events, coordinated cross-functional initiatives, and grounded my work in a growth mindset and clear communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Passionate about learning new technologies and tackling complex challenges, I continuously enhance my expertise and contribute meaningful solutions—whether in cloud-native systems, mobile applications, or data-driven platforms.
